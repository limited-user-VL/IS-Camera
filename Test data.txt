1. Acquisition #1 - 17.29.50 tomography.pkl (z from 14.6 to 16.6, PWM = 7%, exp = 1/40 000, 25us)
2. Acquisition #2 - 17.44.35 tomography.pkl (z from 14.6 to 17.6, PWM = 7%, exp = 1/40 000, 25us)

3. Acquisition #3 - 17.50.51 tomography.pkl (z from 14.6 to 18.6, PWM = 8%, exp = 1/40 000, 25us) - seems decoupled

4. Acquisition #4 - (re-coupled) - 17.56.48 tomography.pkl (z from 14.7 to 18.7)
5. Acquisition #5 - 18.02.48 tomography.pkl -same as acquisition 4, after rechecking coupling;
